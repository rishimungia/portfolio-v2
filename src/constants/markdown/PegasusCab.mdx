A script mod for Grand Theft Auto V, introducing a ride-hailing system like Uber, allowing players to summon cabs via in-game phone.

To order, simply call the Pegasus Cab contact from your in-game phone and choose your preferred cab type.

## Implementation

- Majority of the logic for the mod was wrtten in C# using the `ScriptHook V` library along with `ScriptHook V.NET` plugin to allow development in C#.
- The in-game phone contact is added using the `iFruitAddon2` addon script.
- To create the cab selection menu I used the open-source `LemonUI` library that provides the ability to draw GTA's native menu UIs on screen.
