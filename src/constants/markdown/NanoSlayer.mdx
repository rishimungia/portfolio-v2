        ## Player Mechanics
        Since this is core part of the game, it took the most time to perfect. A bad player controller can easily break immersion and break the game so I put a lot of effort to make the movement as fluid as possible. There are some special player mechanics apart from base movement: 

        - Wall Sliding
        - Double Jump
        - Wall Jump

## Enemies and Powers

Currently there are three enemy types each with it's own behaviour and attacks so they give the player a good amount of challenge. But fret not as our protagonist has some cool gadgets and powerups in it's arsenal. I am not going to spoil all the fun so instead let's take a look at the different foes you'll be facing...

        ### Jumper
        This is one of the more annoing ones to kill. It jumps above the player and does a massive damage by directly landing on the head.

        ### Atomic Crab
        It's the result of a radioactive experiment on a crab gone very WRONG! It shoots radioactive projectiles that explode instantly on impact. However it dosent like to be in close contact to the player.

        ### Robo Spider
        This sneaky spider has just one goal, to sneak up behind the Slayer and Go BOOM! And it is most definately not a reskined Minecraft Creeper.

## Graphics and Art

The game assets all follow pixel-art style. It makes the task of asset creation easy and is pleasing to look at. Along with that Unity's new 2D Lights bundled with the Universal Render Pipeline gives the whole level a sense of depth. And not to forget Unity's amazing Particle System which brings the game world to life, it gives simple boring looking scenes a sence of motion.
