The idea for this bot originated from the #COVIDSOS trend on Twitter. The goal was to create a bot that can help users find relevant information without going through the hassel of digging through thousands of tweets.

## Auto-reply

The bot can reply to mention tweets on it's timeline. It is configured to automaticly reply to mentions with hashtags like #reply, #COVIDSOS, #covidDM, etc. This module also manages enrollment of users to the Direct Messages feature, it looks for keywords like: '#coviddm start' and initiates the CovidDM module.

## CovidDM

        - `CovidSOS[Location][Requirement]`: Get relevant #COVIDSOS Tweets.
        - `Stop`: Unenroll from the CovidDM module.
